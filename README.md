# Sheep_Counter
This project can be used for counting ships inside the farm

## Problem Statement
>  Imagine a flock of sheep, one by one moving in and out of a fenced grassland. Now the shepherd wants a device attached to the fence door that keeps track of the number of sheep inside the land.
>  So create a Tinkercad simulation of a device that is suitable for this job. 

## Solution/Working

### Entering the Farm
>- As Sheep will enter the farm first of all 1st senser will be active
>- if she moves forward both 1st and 2nd sensers will be active
>- Again if she moves forward  2nd senser will be active and 1st will be inactive
>- Finally when the sheep is fully entered in farm both sensers 1 and 2 will be inactive
>- Hence count will increase by 1

### Leaving the Farm
>- As Sheep will leave the farm first of all 2st senser will be active
>- if she moves forward both 1st and 2nd sensers will be active
>- Again if she moves forward  1st senser will be active and 2nd will be inactive
>- Finally when the sheep has fully leaved the farm both sensers 1 and 2 will be inactive
>- Hence count will decrease by 1

## Note
> - Breadth of passage for sheep to pass should be 2.5 meter.
> - Sensers should be 50 cm away from the length of passage
